VIM FILES
=========

This is the home of TheRedMoods vimfiles. Stolen from near and far, this
collection of vimness will continue to expand as I go about learning the
editor and the configuratio language it uses.

SETUP
-----

This is for downloading and setting up the repository:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/TheRedMood/red-vim.git ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then create the symlinks:

```Shell
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
