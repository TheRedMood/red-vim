VIM FILES
=========

This is the home of TheRedMoods vimfiles. Stolen from near and far, this
collection of vimness will continue to expand as I go about learning the
editor and the configuratio language it uses.

SETUP
-----

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/TheRedMood/red-vim.git ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

VUNDLE
---
I will write more here later. Look at the "Vundler.vim" file in the .vim dir.
